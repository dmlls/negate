class Token:
    """A token, i.e., a sequence of characters.

    A :obj:`spacy.tokens.Token` is read-only. See
    `https://spacy.io/api/token`__. Furthermore, it cannot hold an empty string
    as :attr:`text`. This class is just a minimal equivalent to a spaCy token
    that is both writable and allows empty strings as text. It only contains the
    attributes relevant for our purposes.

    Attributes:
        text (:obj:`str`):
            The characters that form the token.
        has_space_after (:obj:`str`):
            Whether the token is followed by a whitespace (this whitespace is
            not part of the :attr:`text`). This information is used for
            de-tokenization.
